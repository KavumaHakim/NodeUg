# NodeUg

**NodeUg** stands for *Nodes that connect young Ugandan coders*.

NodeUg is a peer-to-peer developer platform built specifically for Ugandan coders. It is a developer ecosystem designed to **teach, connect, and empower young Ugandan developers**, with a strong focus on collaboration, learning, and real-world problem solving.

## Overview

NodeUg helps young Ugandan coders connect, share code, solve errors together, and collaborate on real-life projects. It enables direct messaging between developers using IP addresses, reducing reliance on centralized servers and encouraging true peer-to-peer communication.

The platform allows developers to share files, code, and images through a dedicated interface. It offers a terminal-style environment inspired by Kali Linux, giving users a strong, hands-on, “real tech” experience that feels purposeful and focused.

## Features

- Peer-to-peer messaging using IP addresses  
- File, code, and image sharing  
- Terminal-inspired developer interface  
- Project collaboration and peer learning  
- Offline communication over LAN and Wi-Fi  
- Online communication across the country  
- Cross-platform support for PCs and mobile devices  

## Collaboration & Learning

NodeUg supports project collaboration where active developers can receive projects, work on them, and explain solutions to others. It promotes learning, problem-solving, and community building among Ugandan coders.

The idea behind NodeUg comes from the overuse of platforms like WhatsApp for coding and developer collaboration. While we often claim to be Uganda’s future in tech, we still rely heavily on general-purpose chat apps for serious development work.

NodeUg is designed to replace WhatsApp for *coder-specific interactions*, encouraging developers to spend less time on distractions and more time building real, impactful products. You cannot be scrolling statuses when you are building a banking system. NodeUg is meant to train us for the future we claim to be building.

## Terminal Commands

NodeUg includes its own command-style interactions, such as:

```bash
nodeug send <IP> <msg>
nodeug listen
nodeug history
```

## Networking

Supports online communication across the country

Enables communication with nearby IP addresses without internet access

## Platform Support
NodeUg is cross-platform and works on both PCs and mobile phones. It includes:

A desktop application

A mobile application with a terminal-like experience, similar to tools such as Termux

## Tools & Technologies
NodeUg is built using modern web and mobile technologies:

React – web application and interface logic

React Native – cross-platform mobile application development

Tailwind CSS – UI styling and responsive design

WebSockets / Networking APIs – real-time communication

Local storage & logging mechanisms – message and activity history

Git – version control and collaboration
